                <p>
                During mid 2021, I grew an interest in programming and technologies. At the time i didn't have a an idea of which field i wanted to delve into, 
                and deciding on that wasn't as easy as i though it would be.</p>
                <p>
                    I initially got into python programming from FreeCodeCamp, which i owe a good about of my knowledge towards. My first thought was to get in to data analysis with it.
                    However, I got myself more familiar with web development i came to find it more appealing.

                    However, I got myself more familiar with web development i came to find it more appealing.</p>
                <p>I completed Responsive Web Design course with FreeCodeCamp, although it took a while to get a good grip of it. after that, I completed their javascript course, it was it this this I decided to avoid anything that has to do with web design</p>
                
                <P>I decided to get into backend Development with Python using the Django framework. Compared to frontend, i came to find it more appealing and enjoyable. Watching Dennis Ivy's tutorials on YouTube helped me esponentially in learning and understanding the django framework</P>
                <P>At some point i joined the GDSC group at my school and i noticed my skills and productivity reaching breaking its limits. Initially, i would struggle to make a simple web application. But now I got better at making designing, learning more technologies and trying out bigger projects. I guess thats what being surrounded by people better than you does</P>
