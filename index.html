                <p class="story">
                    In mid-2021, I developed an interest in programming and technology without a clear direction. Initially exploring Python and data analysis through FreeCodeCamp, I later found web development more appealing. Completing FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design and JavaScript courses, I decided to focus on backend development with Python and Django.</p>
                    
                <P>Dennis Ivy's YouTube tutorials significantly aided my understanding of Django.
                    After joining the GDSC group at my school, I noticed a massive boost in my skills and productivity, transforming my struggle with simple web applications into proficiency in design, attempting to learn new technologies, and tackling larger projects. Surrounding myself with talented peers fueled my growth.</P>

I always found it funny. but since then. he has gone throu a decent amaount of improvement when it comes to web design, he still has to learn how to integrate JavaScript into his HTML files, and above that, React. He may be quite loose, but he won't stop even after getting there.</p>
